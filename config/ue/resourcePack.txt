This File only exists so the new Unique Enchantments Enchanted Book texture pack is loaded by default but still can be turned off. Since neither Vanilla or forge are capable of having defaulty enabled ResourcePacks and forges config sucks so bad that you can't have configs that load before texture packs load so we have to do this shitty solution to make it work!
